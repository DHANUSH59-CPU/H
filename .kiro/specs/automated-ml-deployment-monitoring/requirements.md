# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create an automated ML model deployment and monitoring system suitable for a hackathon demonstration. The system will showcase the complete lifecycle of ML model management, from training to deployment to monitoring, with minimal manual intervention. Given the 2-hour constraint and beginner-friendly approach, the focus will be on creating a working prototype that demonstrates key concepts rather than production-ready infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to automatically train and deploy ML models, so that I can focus on model development rather than infrastructure management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides training data THEN the system SHALL automatically train a machine learning model
2. WHEN model training is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy the model to a serving endpoint
3. WHEN the model is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a REST API for making predictions
4. IF training fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor deployed models automatically, so that I can detect performance issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model makes predictions THEN the system SHALL log prediction requests and responses
2. WHEN prediction accuracy drops below a threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger an alert
3. WHEN data drift is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the model for retraining
4. WHEN monitoring metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL display them in a dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to see model performance metrics in real-time, so that I can make informed decisions about model usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current model accuracy metrics
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show prediction volume over time
3. WHEN model performance changes THEN the system SHALL update metrics in real-time
4. IF multiple models are deployed THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between models

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated model retraining capabilities, so that models stay current with new data patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics indicate model degradation THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger retraining
2. WHEN new training data is available THEN the system SHALL evaluate if retraining is needed
3. WHEN retraining completes THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy the updated model
4. IF retraining fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the current model and alert administrators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple interface to interact with the ML system, so that I can easily integrate it into applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making prediction requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
3. WHEN accessing the system THEN the system SHALL provide API documentation
4. WHEN integrating with the system THEN the system SHALL support standard HTTP methods and JSON format
